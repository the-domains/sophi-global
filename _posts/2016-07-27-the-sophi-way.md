# The SOPHI Way

**We are dot-connectors and problem solvers. **

We believe in leveraging the latest technology platforms to provide innovative and vertically integrated services to clients, by utilizing a city-wide network of partnerships only a valet infrastructure can provide.

**We reject the idea that for us to win, someone must lose.**

We believe that long-term success can only be achieved by inspiring trust and keeping a win/win/win strategy in mind for our clients, guests, and the SOPHI team.

**Our employees are our greatest resource.**

We believe in delivering the highest quality of service by empowering, rewarding, and holding accountable the best employees.
